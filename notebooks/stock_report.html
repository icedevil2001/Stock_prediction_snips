            GURUGRAM: A call centre that had in just three weeks of existence allegedly cheated more than 30,000 Americans by posting malware links on their PCs and then offering technical support to fix it was found operating from an upscale business centre on Sohna Road on Saturday by the CID’s chief minister’s flying squad.Ironically, the two who ran the criminal operation are familiar faces for the law. They had been arrested last year running a similar bogus call centre from Udyog Vihar but were out on bail and had got right back to the swindling business.Vikram Verma, a resident of Delhi, and his partner Rishab, a resident of Gurgaon, have been charged under section 420 (cheating) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and sections of the of IT Act in the FIR filed at Sadar police station.The Sohna Road call centre underscores the law and order challenge cyber police still face in the national capital region, which has been on the radar of international law enforcement agencies, including America’s FBI, since a large number of crook calls were traced to cities around Delhi, particularly Gurgaon and Noida.<br/><br/>
